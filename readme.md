### *Goal*
This application was built as an exercise in client side javascript using jQuery and Bootstrap. The classic word game Scrabble was used as basis to focus the effort on code development rather than designing game mechanics, etc. Scrabble is owned by Hasbro and you should totally buy it from them because it's rad!

### *Technologies*
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

### *Gameplay*
No installation is required as the game only uses client-side javascript. However there is no state persistence, so refreshing the page will reset the game.

### *Future Development*
- Support for 'blank' tiles
- End of game condition when all tiles in the bag have been exhausted and each player has passed consecutively
- Persisting game state
- Allowing multiple remote players using socket.io
